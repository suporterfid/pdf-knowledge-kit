# View Development Logs

Display logs from running containers, useful for debugging and monitoring the application.

## Steps

1. Show logs from all containers with timestamps
2. Follow the logs in real-time (tail mode)
3. If a specific service is mentioned (api, frontend, db), show logs only for that service

Use docker compose logs command with appropriate flags for readability.
