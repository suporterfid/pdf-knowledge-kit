# Start Development Environment

Start the full development stack (database, backend, frontend) with hot-reload enabled.

## Steps

1. Stop any running containers
2. Start the development environment with Docker Compose
3. Show the status of all containers
4. Display URLs for accessing the services

Use the combined docker-compose files for development mode with volume mounts for live code reloading.
