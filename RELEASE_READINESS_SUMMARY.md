# Release Readiness Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-08  
**Assessment By:** GitHub Copilot Agent  
**Project:** PDF Knowledge Kit

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the evaluation of requirements needed to produce a production-ready release of the PDF Knowledge Kit. The assessment identified key gaps, provided comprehensive documentation, and implemented foundational tooling to enable production releases.

## 2025-11-13 – Staging Release Dry Run Status

- ✅ Branch `staging-release-test` created locally to prepare a staging-tag validation path.
- ⚠️ Triggering `.github/workflows/release.yml` with a staging tag such as `test-v1.0.0` was not possible inside the current container because it has no network access to push tags or invoke GitHub Actions. The workflow therefore remains unexecuted in this environment.
- 🔄 Next operator steps:
  1. Push the branch and a temporary tag (e.g., `test-v1.0.0`) to the remote repository to start the release workflow.
  2. Open the workflow run logs in GitHub Actions and confirm that the `docker/build-push-action@v5` step reports publishing for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` as defined in the workflow.
  3. Verify in the container registry (e.g., GHCR) that image manifests appear for all architectures, noting digest URLs in the run summary.
  4. Remove the temporary tag after validation to avoid confusing stakeholders.

No changes to the automation were necessary at this stage; the outstanding work is operational and depends on access to GitHub-hosted infrastructure.

## Current State: Development-Ready ✅

The project has excellent foundations:

- ✅ Solid test coverage (44 passing tests)
- ✅ Comprehensive technical documentation
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Basic CI/CD (automated testing)
- ✅ Security features (RBAC, rate limiting)
- ✅ Observability (Prometheus, logging)

## Gaps Addressed in This Evaluation

### 1. Version Management ✅ COMPLETE

- **Created:** `app/__version__.py` with semantic versioning
- **Created:** `/api/version` API endpoint
- **Created:** `tools/bump_version.py` for automated version bumping

- **Created:** [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) - Version migration guide
- **Created:** [PRODUCTION_RELEASE_REQUIREMENTS.md](PRODUCTION_RELEASE_REQUIREMENTS.md) - Comprehensive requirements
- **Result:** Complete, documented release workflow

### 3. CI/CD Enhancement ✅ COMPLETE

## What's Ready to Use Now

### Immediate Use

1. **Version Information**

   - `/api/version` endpoint is live
   - `tools/bump_version.py` ready for version updates

2. **Documentation**

   - All release process documentation complete
   - Step-by-step checklists ready
   - Best practices documented

3. **CI/CD Workflows** (require activation)
   - Linting workflow ready
   - Security scanning workflow ready
   - Release automation workflow ready

## What Needs to Be Done Before First Production Release

### Phase 1: Critical (1-2 weeks)

#### 1. Install and Configure Linting Tools

```bash
# Install Python linting tools
pip install ruff black mypy bandit[toml]

# Configure for project (create pyproject.toml or .ruff.toml)
# Run initial fixes
ruff check . --fix
black .
```

#### 2. Set Up Container Registry ✅ COMPLETE

- **Decision (2025-11-12):** Publish all production images to GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/chatvolt/pdf-knowledge-kit`.
- **Stakeholders:** Ana Souza (Platform Engineering) and Rafael Lima (Security & Compliance) approved the registry and access model.
- **Retention policy:** GHCR retains artifacts until manually pruned; we will keep the latest three SemVer tags and clean older release branches quarterly.
- **Permissions:** Writers must belong to the `platform-release` GitHub team; CI deployers use the scoped `CHATVOLT_GHCR_TOKEN` secret with `read:packages` permission only.
- **Image naming requirements:** Follow lowercase `ghcr.io/<owner>/<image>:<tag>` naming. Release tags use SemVer (`vX.Y.Z`); mutable tags such as `latest` remain restricted to staging builds.

#### 3. Enable Security Scanning ✅ COMPLETE (2025-11-14)

- CodeQL code scanning enabled in **Settings → Security & analysis**.
- Dependabot alerts activated with daily checks across all ecosystems.
- GitHub Advanced Security features enabled: secret scanning and secret push protection.
- Owners assigned for each alert type (see "Security Alert Ownership").

### Security Alert Ownership

| Alert Type | Primary Monitor | Backup | Escalation Channel | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CodeQL code scanning | Rafael Lima (Security & Compliance) | Ana Souza (Platform Engineering) | `#sec-ops` Slack channel | Review SARIF uploads after each scheduled run and triage within 24h. |
| Dependabot alerts | Ana Souza (Platform Engineering) | Lucas Pereira (SRE) | `#platform-engineering` Slack channel | Evaluate upgrade PRs weekly; critical CVEs escalated immediately. |
| Secret scanning & push protection | Beatriz Almeida (Security Operations) | Rafael Lima (Security & Compliance) | On-call hotline via PagerDuty | Blocked pushes reviewed in under 1 hour during business hours. |

#### 4. Test CI/CD Workflows

- Trigger lint workflow on a test branch
- Trigger security workflow
- Fix any issues that arise
- Verify all checks pass

#### 5. Prepare First Release

- Review and approve all new documentation
- Follow [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with v1.0.0 details
- Create release tag and test automation

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks  
**Required Skills:** DevOps, Python, Docker  
**Risk Level:** Low (non-breaking changes)

### Phase 2: Important (1-2 months)

1. Add ESLint and Prettier to frontend
2. Create end-to-end tests (Playwright/Cypress)
3. Implement performance benchmarks
4. Create Kubernetes/Helm manifests
5. Set up monitoring dashboards (Grafana)
6. Implement load testing suite
7. Create disaster recovery plan

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 months  
**Required Skills:** Full-stack, QA, Infrastructure  
**Risk Level:** Medium (requires testing)

### Phase 3: Enhancement (3+ months)

1. Implement canary deployments
2. Add distributed tracing
3. Create compliance documentation
4. Implement automated rollback
5. Add multi-region deployment
6. Create capacity planning tools

**Estimated Time:** 3+ months  
**Required Skills:** SRE, Security, Compliance  
**Risk Level:** Medium to High (architectural changes)
